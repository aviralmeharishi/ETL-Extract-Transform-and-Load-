# 🚀 Basic ETL Project – From Raw Data to Ready-to-Use!

Welcome to my **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** project!  
This is a beginner-friendly project where I take raw data from a CSV file, clean it up, and store it in a MySQL database – all using Python.  
Think of it as giving messy data a shower and a new home 😄
